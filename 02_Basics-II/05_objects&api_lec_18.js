//* To access a property of an object

//* Method-I
console.log(course.price) //! Using dot operator

//We can also access the property using object destructuring

//* Object Destructuring

const {price} = course //using this, we can easily access price (property) of the object without using couse.price again and again

console.log(price) //999

//! Using our custom name

const {courseName : naam} = course //! Here, we can acess course.courseName directly by using naam

console.log(naam) //this works
console.log(courseName) //Note: This doesn't work now!!!! (since we have used custom name here for our course.courseName)
