}

user2.greet() //My name is W Kumar and age is 18
//? Clearly, from the output we can see that we got the name of user2, but the age of user. Why?? Because we didn't use "this" keyword for the age property

//Note: Without "this" keyword, we would need to rewrite the method for every object, which defeats the purpose of object-oriented programming (i.e. we can't reuse our codes, without "this" keyword)

//Note: This is one of the reasons to use "this" keyword
