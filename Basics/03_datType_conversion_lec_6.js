//Conversion from one data-type to others

//Converting to number

let score = "33"

let scoreInNumber = Number (score) //This converts the string into a number

//Hence, we can similarly convert to any dat-type by simple using its name with first letter as capital, like- String, Number, Boolean etc

console.log(typeof score) //string
console.log(typeof scoreInNumber) //number 

//What if, if the string has letters as well??

let x = "33abc"
let convertToNumber = Number (x)

console.log(convertToNumber) //NaN (it means not a number- since we encountered letters in the variable x)
console.log(typeof convertToNumber) //number
